{ "about": "I have been making games and programming for over 10 years. I enjoy creating cool things that are fun to both make and use. I have participated in multiple Global Game Jams. In 2014 I participated in the E3 Collegiate Competition where my game placed in the top 5. I am proficient in multiple programming languages as well as visual programs such as Maya or Photoshop. I thrive on self-sufficiency and a good rapport with my superiors and coworkers, and I work well in teams, too!" }
